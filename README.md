# Amazon's Best-Selling Books from 2009-2019 Project (R)

In my Marketing Analytics class in the SCU MSBA program, I got the opportunity to work on my 2nd data analytics project, this time utilizing
R. Prior to the class, I had never used it before. Luckily, most of R's functionality and commands are quite similar to Python Pandas,
which made learning it much more intuitive.

The dataset contains 550 rows of best-selling books sold on Amazon from 2009 to 2019. There are 7 variables available in the 
dataset, including the book title, author, user rating, number of reviews, price of the book, the year the book was considered a 
“best-seller,” and book genre.

This time, I got to collaborate with old and new partners
[Aaron Huang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-huang-scu/), [Aditi Bagepalli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditibagepalli/), 
[Riley Kates](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riley-kates/), and 
[Yasmeen Gavande](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angel-investing/). Our task was to figure out what factors would lead to a best-selling book.

The three main steps we took were an EDA analysis, statistical modeling (using multiple regression and cluster analysis), and finding recommendations. For an in-depth look at our dataset, please take a look at our report [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C4GuHYbQA7oyNGj8uBtQ5z29XH_jUW7wvHv6qw9chSU/edit?usp=sharing). The project's charts and figures can be found in our [appendix](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n_J_oEVUa7tbNdvfSLz08R5ytFA4DRpF6xceAV5NmT4/edit?usp=sharing).

Overall, I learned a great deal of different ways to visualize data in a simple yet effective manner and how to utilize different modeling techniques such as hierarchical clustering, k-means clustering, and multiple regression. I realized how powerful R can be and how our team managed to transform a small dataset into a full-blown analysis. Looking forward to use it more often in the near future!
